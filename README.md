# 20 TPS Minecraft Server
 A preconfigured minecraft server, Optimized for Low Ram and Large Servers.
 
 This server uses paper as it's the most stable and most update server for mincraft and adds even more optimizations
 However you can choose to replace the server jar with any other server wich you will find the download below.
 All of the configs are optimized and will be optimized more and they should be compatible with any server you will choose over paper.
 Consider using paper for best performance anyway.
