# Ready to use 20 TPS Minecraft Server

# 23/02/2022: This Repository may be incomplete as this is a cancelled project and i'm not maintaining it anymore.

 A preconfigured minecraft server, Optimized for both Low Specs and Large Specs Servers.
 
 This server uses paper as it's the most stable and most updated server for mincraft and adds even more optimizations
 However you can choose to replace the server jar with any other server wich you will find the download below.
 All of the configs are optimized and will be optimized more and they should be compatible with any server you will choose over paper.
 Consider using paper for best performance anyway.
 
 This will come with a paper jar included, but it will be obsolete as the time you see this repository, so please download it yourself from the link below.
 
Server are listed in order of levels if you choose Vanilla only the basic cfg will be used, if you use Paper Vanilla, Bukkit, Spigot and Paper cfg's will be used all togheter and grant better customization and optimization.
